# How To Set Up a React Project with Vite

# Prerequisites
If you don't have git on your machine, install it.

# Fork the Repository
Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page. This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

# Clone This Repository

Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the copy to clipboard icon.

Open a terminal and run the following git command:
$ git clone "url you just copied"


where "url you just copied" (without the quotation marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project). See the previous steps to obtain the url.

For example:

$ git clone git@github.com:this-is-you/netflix-clone.git

where this-is-you is your GitHub username. Here you're copying the contents of the first-contributions repository on GitHub to your computer.

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):
$ cd netflic-clone

# Run the Project

In order to to run it you can just run the command:
$ npm install

All necessary dependencies will be installed.Then you have to go to src folder and then request.js file. in that file please add your own TMDB API KEY.

then run your project locally by run the command
$ npm run dev
that command will run this project locally on your network http://your_ip_address:5173/

Best of Luck
